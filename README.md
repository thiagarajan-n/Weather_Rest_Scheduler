# Weather_Rest_Scheduler
This is Rest service controller and scheduler to update and fetch weather details from DB

This project is built using SpringBoot and maven.

I've used MySQL DB. But on ideal production deployment, i would recocmmend a NoSQL DB as there will be more read and less write.

To start a spring boot application, refer https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-running-your-application.html
